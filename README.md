## Overview

> **Note**: `LIBRARY_UPDATE` events from Figma seem bugged (webhooks are beta btw), they stream in 1 after the other, and would require some batch request handling to limit the amount of noise sent to Discord â€” for now they are just relayed through.

Cloudflare Worker listening to `LIBRARY_UPDATE` and `FILE_VERSION_UPDATE` events from Figma and sends them to a Discord channel webhook.

A webhook request is sent to this worker as soon as one of the Figma files listed in the KV is published.
If the correct payload is received, and validated (proper passcode, event, and file_key) then a Discord message is crafted and sent to the webhook url of your choice (per file_key).

> **Note**: Don't want an event to be sent to Discord? In Figma include `#exclude` in your commit description and it will be ignored.

## Setup Figma Webhook

To add this webhook you must have `Admin` permissions over the team in which the file you want to track lives. Replace the variables below with real ones and send the curl request.

**Note:** You must be listed as a team admin even if you have Organization admin permissions ([see here](https://forum.figma.com/t/403-access-denied-trying-to-use-the-webhook-api/7638)).

### Add Webhook

```
curl -X POST -H 'X-FIGMA-TOKEN: <personal access token>' -H "Content-Type: application/json" 'https://api.figma.com/v2/webhooks' -d '{"event_type":"LIBRARY_PUBLISH","team_id":"YOUR_TEAM_ID","endpoint":"YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL","passcode":"YOUR_PASSCODE","description":"Design System Library Publish Events"}'
```

### Get All Webhooks for team
